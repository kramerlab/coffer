home.welcome = This QSAR service predicts chemical compounds. It employs \
circular fingerprints (CFPs) and provides rationals for predictions. \
A paper has been submitted to the Journal of Cheminformatics.

model.prediction.tip = The model provides a probability with each prediction, that indicates the classifier's confidence for the predicted class.

model.measured = Measured
model.measured.tip = The compound might be already included in the training dataset.
